#Step 1:
# Import libraries
# In this section, you can use a search engine to look for the functions that will help you implement the following steps


#Step 2:
# Load dataset and show basic statistics
# 1. Show dataset size (dimensions)
# 2. Show what column names exist for the 49 attributes in the dataset
# 3. Show the distribution of the target class CES 4.0 Percentile Range column
# 4. Show the percentage distribution of the target class CES 4.0 Percentile Range column


# Step 3:
#Clean the dataset - you can eitherhandle the missing values in the dataset
# with the mean of the columns attributes or remove rows the have missing values.


# Step 4: 
#Encode the Categorical Variables - Using OrdinalEncoder from the category_encoders library to encode categorical variables as ordinal integers


# Step 5: 
# Separate predictor variables from the target variable (attributes (X) and target variable (y) as we did in the class)
# Create train and test splits for model development. Use the 90% and 20% split ratio
# Use stratifying (stratify=y) to ensure class balance in train/test splits
# Name them as X_train, X_test, y_train, and y_test
# Name them as X_train, X_test, y_train, and y_test
X_train = [] # Remove this line after implementing train test split
X_test = [] # Remove this line after implementing train test split


# Do not do steps 6 - 8 for the Ramdom Forest Model
# Step 6:
# Standardize the features (Import StandardScaler here)



# Step 7:
# Below is the code to convert X_train and X_test into data frames for the next steps
cols = X_train.columns
X_train = pd.DataFrame(X_train, columns=[cols]) # pd is the imported pandas lirary - Import pandas as pd
X_test = pd.DataFrame(X_test, columns=[cols]) # pd is the imported pandas lirary - Import pandas as pd



# Step 8 - Build and train the SVM classifier
# Train SVM with the following parameters. (use the parameters with the highest accuracy for the model)
   #    1. RBF kernel
   #    2. C=10.0 (Higher value of C means fewer outliers)
   #    3. gamma = 0.3 (Linear)



# Test the above developed SVC on unseen pulsar dataset samples

# compute and print accuracy score



# Save your SVC model (whatever name you have given your model) as .sav to upload with your submission
# You can use the library pickle to save and load your model for this assignment




# Optional: You can print test results of your model here if you want. Otherwise implement them in evaluation.py file
# Get and print confusion matrix

cm = [[]]
# Below are the metrics for computing classification accuracy, precision, recall and specificity
TP = cm[0,0]
TN = cm[1,1]
FP = cm[0,1]
FN = cm[1,0]

# Compute Precision and use the following line to print it
precision = 0 # Change this line to implement Precision formula
print('Precision : {0:0.3f}'.format(precision))


# Compute Recall and use the following line to print it
recall = 0 # Change this line to implement Recall formula
print('Recall or Sensitivity : {0:0.3f}'.format(recall))

# Compute Specificity and use the following line to print it
specificity = 0 # Change this line to implement Specificity formula
print('Specificity : {0:0.3f}'.format(specificity))






# Step 9: Build and train the Random Forest classifier
# Train Random Forest  with the following parameters.
# (n_estimators=10, random_state=0)

# Test the above developed Random Forest model on unseen DACs dataset samples

# compute and print accuracy score

# Save your Random Forest model (whatever name you have given your model) as .sav to upload with your submission
# You can use the library pickle to save and load your model for this assignment

# Optional: You can print test results of your model here if you want. Otherwise implement them in evaluation.py file
# Get and print confusion matrix
cm = [[]]
# Below are the metrics for computing classification accuracy, precision, recall and specificity
TP = cm[0,0]
TN = cm[1,1]
FP = cm[0,1]
FN = cm[1,0]


# Compute Classification Accuracy and use the following line to print it
classification_accuracy = 0
print('Classification accuracy : {0:0.4f}'.format(classification_accuracy))

# Compute Precision and use the following line to print it
precision = 0 # Change this line to implement Precision formula
print('Precision : {0:0.3f}'.format(precision))


# Compute Recall and use the following line to print it
recall = 0 # Change this line to implement Recall formula
print('Recall or Sensitivity : {0:0.3f}'.format(recall))

# Compute Specificity and use the following line to print it
specificity = 0 # Change this line to implement Specificity formula
print('Specificity : {0:0.3f}'.format(specificity))
